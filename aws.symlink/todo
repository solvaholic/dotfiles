# Decide where to store and/or publish presets, defaults, etc

# Decide how to implement short-cut scripts or functions
# - I think the --filter feature will help
# - I expect some built-in features I've yet to discover will help
# - I want short commands to:
#   - Inventory stuff I have on AWS
#   - Create, edit, and remove DNS records in Route53
#   - Find versioned AMIs I use a lot
#   - Launch EC2 instances I use a lot
#   - Change instance state for one or more EC2 instances
#   - Do serverless stuff, whenever I get around to that

# Implement short-cut scripts or functions

# Build install.sh
